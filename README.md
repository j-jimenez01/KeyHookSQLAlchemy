# SQL Alchemy Database 

This project demonstrates the usage of SQL Alchemy, a popular Python library, to interact with a backend database in PostgreSQL. SQL Alchemy provides a convenient and intuitive way to store, access, and update data in a database.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure that you have the following:

1. Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org).

2. PostgreSQL: Install PostgreSQL on your machine. You can download PostgreSQL from the official PostgreSQL website: [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org).

3. SQL Alchemy: Install SQL Alchemy library using pip by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```shell
   pip install sqlalchemy
   ```

## Getting Started

To use SQL Alchemy for database operations, follow these steps:

1. Set up your PostgreSQL database: Create a new database or use an existing one. Make sure you have the necessary credentials (host, port, database name, username, and password) to connect to the database.

2. Update the connection details: Open the Python file or script where you'll be using SQL Alchemy. Look for the database connection section and update the connection details with your PostgreSQL credentials.

3. Define database models: Define the structure of your database by creating Python classes that represent database tables. Use SQL Alchemy's declarative base class and define table columns and their data types using SQLAlchemy data types.

4. Establish a connection: Use SQL Alchemy to establish a connection to your PostgreSQL database using the provided connection details.

5. Perform database operations: Use SQL Alchemy's query API to perform various database operations such as inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data from the database. Refer to the SQL Alchemy documentation for more details on using the query API.

6. Execute the script or run the application: Execute the Python script or run the application that uses SQL Alchemy for database operations. Verify that the desired operations are performed correctly on your PostgreSQL database.
